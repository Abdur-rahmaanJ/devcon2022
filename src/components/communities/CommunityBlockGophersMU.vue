        <p>
          We are gophers (Go developers) from the paradise island of Mauritius.
          <br />
          Our aim is to promote usage and knowledge sharing of the Go
          programming language through meetups and networking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our fellowship is a new one, initiated by developers who fell in love
          with Go and have used it professionally. We look forward to sharing
          our experience with more people; hoping we can make friends to learn
          and laugh along the way.
        </p>
