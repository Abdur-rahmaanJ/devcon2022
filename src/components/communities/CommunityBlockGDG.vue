					The GDG Mauritius is a local community-ran meetup for developers
					interested in resources and technology from Google Developers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The MSCC has an annual event called the Developers Conference which is
					free of charge community-driven, IT tech conference hosted annually in
					Mauritius. Since 2016 there is an extra venue at the Flying Dodo.
				</p>
				<p>
					GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in
					Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and
					can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a
					few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large
					gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Disclaimer: GDG Mauritius is an independent user group; our activities
					and the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to Google,
					the corporation.
